dumb tray app thing i made to farm hours in [Are You Ready for Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070910/Are_you_ready_for_Valve_Index/)

theres also a version for [SteamVR Performance Test](https://store.steampowered.com/app/323910/SteamVR_Performance_Test/)

\
add this to the steam launch options
```
"path\to\AYRVI.exe" %command%
```
\
double-clicking the icon will open the library page for ayrvi

the vanilla compatapp.exe can be started through the context menu if you want to actually check if you're ready for valve index

it automatically closes itself if you put your system to sleep because steam  detects that and takes away hours
